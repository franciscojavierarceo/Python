      "A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance Taube, M. Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity. \n",

An experiment was conducted to determine which of four types of lexical indicators of content could be utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100 questions.  The results indicate that there were no major differences between the groups using complete text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but the group utilizing the complete text obtained a significantly higher score on the examination. \n",

      "Article 42: The Notion of Relevance Hillman, Donald J. Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article.. \n",

A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently, and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured.. \n",
      "Article 52: Comparative Indexing: Terms Supplied by Biomedical Authors and by Document Titles Schultz, Claire K. Schultz, Wallace L. Orr, Richard H. The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the much argued question of whether author indexing is \"good\".. Author indexing of 285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author- supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same document.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of wide applicability.. \n",

The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources.. MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than other non-ophthalmologist searchers.. \n",
      "Article 76: Biomedical Literature: Analysis of Journal Articles Collected by a Radiation- and Cell-Biologist Leith, John D. Jr. The author's journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed according to three \"interest patterns\": (I) the total collection of 1469 article titles, a \"potentially useful\" set; (II) a subset concerning only his research speciality; and (III) a subset of articles defined as \"useful\". For each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram was drawn.. Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect means.. Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use.. The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of titles, are ranked for each pattern.. \n",

      "Article 150: Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA Abbot, M.T.J. Hunter, P.S. Simkins, M.A. During the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical- Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type. \n",

The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however, will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming, simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian. \n",
      "Article 320: The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language Quillian, M.R. The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. \n",

The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.

      "Article 582: Title Indexes as Alerting Services in the Chemical and Life Sciences Bottle, Robert T. The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible.. As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made, ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for some typical services.. \n",
      "Article 589: Are Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative? Tocatlian, Jacques J. The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958.. The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968.. Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index.. \n",

Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision.. A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds.. \n",

Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a document not retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the information transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used as synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal articles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the underlying information transfer principles. \n",

The choice of the suitable data base for providing an information service is governed by factors of coverage, performance, and cost.. The cost of the data base to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the data base producers.. This paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of the four major Chemical Abstracts Service magnetic tape data-base, Chemical Titles (CT), which contains the titles of citations only, Chemical Abstracts Condensates (CAC), which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases, Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC),and Polymer Science and Technology (POST), both of which contain full digests in addition to titles.. The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four data-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions were constructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall ratios) were calculated for each profile.. The overall retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against data-bases containing titles only, titles-plus-keywords, and titles-plus-digests, was calculated, and these results are presented.. \n",
      "Article 820: Studies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms. SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts' Olive, G. Terry, J. E. Datta, S. A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision..

      "Article 894: An Experiment in Index Term Frequency Svenonius, Elaine This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior.. \n",

      "Article 28: A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance Taube, M. Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity. \n",

Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences..

The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the much argued question of whether author indexing is \"good\".. Author indexing of 285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author- supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same document.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of wide applicability.. \n",

      "Article 150: Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA Abbot, M.T.J. Hunter, P.S. Simkins, M.A. During the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical- Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type. \n",

      "Article 320: The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language Quillian, M.R. The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. \n",

      "Article 483: Performance of Automatic Information Systems Lesk, Michael E. The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper design are considered in light of these results.. \n",

      "Article 541: ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials Spalding, C. Sumner At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint working Group of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publications was set up to draw up an International Standard Bibliographic Description for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model in so far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problems presented by serial publications made the task of developing an ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L. Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier. Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen- space and dubbing the happy couple the \"distinctive title.\" \n",

      "Article 582: Title Indexes as Alerting Services in the Chemical and Life Sciences Bottle, Robert T. The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible.. As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made, ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for some typical services.. \n",

      "Article 589: Are Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative? Tocatlian, Jacques J. The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958.. The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968.. Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index.. \n",

      "Article 603: The Efficiency of MEDLARS Titles for Retrieval Miller, William L. Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision.. A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds.. \n",

We have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles, subject headings, abstracts, free-language terms, and combinations of these elements.. The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well.. Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was found to be relatively unimportant.. \n",

A unique method of computerized storage and retrieval of technical information is applied in the SWIFT (Significant Word in Full Title) program.  SWIFT chooses potential keywords from the titles, compares the key words with an exclusion word glossary to remove insignificant words and an internal glossary to prevent duplication of terms.  The keywords may be either a full or fragmented term. An option is available to index also by author.  Indexes, containing full citations, are printed periodically and cumulatively.  The magnetic tape file is available for computer search through a sort and print program.  Responses to inquiries conducted through the computer program are listed in full citation format. \n",

Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a document not retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the information transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used as synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal articles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the underlying information transfer principles. \n",

The choice of the suitable data base for providing an information service is governed by factors of coverage, performance, and cost.. The cost of the data base to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the data base producers.. This paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of the four major Chemical Abstracts Service magnetic tape data-base, Chemical Titles (CT), which contains the titles of citations only, Chemical Abstracts Condensates (CAC), which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases, Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC),and Polymer Science and Technology (POST), both of which contain full digests in addition to titles.. The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four data-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions were constructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall ratios) were calculated for each profile.. The overall retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against data-bases containing titles only, titles-plus-keywords, and titles-plus-digests, was calculated, and these results are presented.. \n",

      "Article 820: Studies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms. SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts' Olive, G. Terry, J. E. Datta, S. A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision.. A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made to identify reasons for failure.. \n",

      "Article 894: An Experiment in Index Term Frequency Svenonius, Elaine This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior.. \n",

      "A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance Taube, M. Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity. \n",

      "Comparisons of Four Types of Lexical Indicators of Content Rath, G.J. Resnick, A. Savage, T.R. An experiment was conducted to determine which of four types of lexical indicators of content could be utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100 questions.  The results indicate that there were no major differences between the groups using complete text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but the group utilizing the complete text obtained a significantly higher score on the examination. \n",
